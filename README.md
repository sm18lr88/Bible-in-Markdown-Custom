# Bible-in-Markdown-Custom

* NKJV NT and OT, plus English Septuagint OT. Organized and designed for my use with Obsidian.md

* The 66 books of the Bible, organized in the traditionally available format with numbered books, as follows:

* "(Sept)" refers to the English Septuagint. Why include this? For backlink/crosslink purposes: many references in the New Testament refer to statements only found in the Septuagint.

* Each Book contains only verses, each marked by Full Name Chapter:Verse, all the way through. There's no need to divide books by chapter.

* Each verse is a Title Level 4, meaning they have four numberals ("####"). This allows for easy creation of links to specific blocks (any verse of the Bible).

# How to Use

* Download the Bible-in-Markdown-Custom.zip file
* Extract the "Bible" folder
* Place "Bible" folder into your Obsidian vault folder.

  * Example to create a link to 1 Samuel 12:22 in the Septuagint version (sorry I haven't made a GIF yet, feel free to contribute):
    * Start by typing "[["
    * You'll now see a menu of all possible links. I start typing "Samu"
    * At this point the menu shows me options like: 9 - 1 Samuel, 10 - 2 Samuel, 9 - (Sept) Samuel, 10 - (Sept) Samuel
    * Use the keyboard arrow keys to highlight "9 - (Sept) Samuel" in the menu, but don't click anything yet
    * While "9 - (Sept) 1 Samuel" is highlighted in this menu, press the "^" key
    * The popout menu now displays all the verses in the entire book of 1 Samuel
    * Now type a specific chapter and verse. Example: "12:22". The popout menu now shows 9 - (Sept) 1 Samuel 12:22 and its contents
    * Now hit the "enter" key
    * Your Obsidian should now display: 9 - (Sept) 1 Samuel#^*****   Where "*" means any random characters used by the program to refer to that specific block.

* Using that example, the way I refer to Bible verses is as follows:
  * Say you want to reference 1 Samuel 12:22-24: 
    * I first type 1 Samuel 12:22-24
    * Then, after that reference, I begin typing "[[" to add a reference to 1 Samuel 12:22 (rather than the range) in the NKJV or Septuagint, because we're simply creating a link to a specific place in Scripture. This now shows me:
